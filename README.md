## üé® UI Design Concepts Used

- **Padding & Spacing**: Controlled using `Padding` and `SizedBox` to create breathing room between elements.
- **Rounded Corners**: `OutlineInputBorder` and `RoundedRectangleBorder` used to give a smooth UI feel.
- **Colors**: Light purple color for input fields and primary buttons.
- **Responsive Scroll**: `SingleChildScrollView` ensures form doesn't overflow on small screens.
