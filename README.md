## Code Highlights

### Form Validator (lib/utils/form_validator.dart)

Reusable form validation methods used in both login and signup forms to keep validation logic clean.

### Bloc Pattern

- `login_bloc.dart` and `signup_bloc.dart` contain event, state, and bloc logic.
- Used BlocProvider and BlocConsumer to manage UI states such as loading, success, and failure.

### Navigation

- After successful sign up, the user is automatically redirected to the Login screen.
- Both login and signup screens have text links to navigate between them (with different colors for actionable words).
